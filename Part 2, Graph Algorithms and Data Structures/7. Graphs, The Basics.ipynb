    "- In an undirected graph, the edges are formed by the undirected edges {v, w}. This mearly means that the vertices have a connection between them and there is no direction necessary for the edge. Thus the edge (v, w) is same as edge (w, v). Friendship in social networking site like Facebook is an example of undirected graph. If Tom is friend of Jerry then Jerry is also a friend of Tom.\n",
    "- Directed graphs on other hand have edges directed **from** node v to w. In this case since the edge originates from v, it is the tail and since it goes to w, w is the head of the edge. The edges (v, w) is not same as (w, v) abd infact one of them may not even exist. Twitter followers can be represented by directed edges. If Tom follows Jerry on twitter, Jerry may or may not follow Tom. Twitter following is not mutual unlike friends on Facebook.\n",

    "Lets consider an undirected graph G with n vertices with no parallel edges (no two vertices have two edges connecting them). What are the minimum and maximum number of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with minimum number of edges, a graph will stay as one graph if we can traverse from one vertex to another. Its not too difficult to see that we will need **n - 1**. That is to connect from a vertex $v_1$, we will have  n - 1 edges to remaining n - 1 vertices $n_2 .. n_n$. Kind of like a hub and spoke where one verted is the hub and other vertices form the end of the spoke.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for maximum edges, we will draw from first vertex, n-1 edges to remaining edges. Then from second vertex have to draw n - 2 edges to remaining vertices. Why n - 2? Its because there already is an edge from first vertex to the second and we dont have parallel edges. Continuing this way, we will have (n - 1) + (n - 1) + (n - 3) + ... + 1 + 0 edges which is same as $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$\n",

Though there is no strict cutoff for considering a graph sparse or dense, we can call a graph sparse if the number of edges is close to linear or dense if it is close to quadratic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus something like $\\theta{(nlogn)}$ is considered sparse whare as $\\theta{(\\frac{n^2}{log n})}$ is dense. Subquadratic like $n^{1.5}$ is either sparse or dense depending on the application\n"

In adjacency list however, getting the adjacent vertices of a vertex is a constant time operation. Also for sparse graphs Adjacency List is the way to go.\n",

At the very minimum, only one vertex connects to all other n - 1 vertices and other n - 1 vertices have degree 1 (connecting to that vertex with degree n - 1). This makes the graph sparse (with minimum number of edges to form the graph). However, the important fact here is it says *At least* which means all vertices can have degree n - 1 in the extreme case which makes it as dense as it can, connecting each vertex to all other vertices.\n",

When we are given a vertex v, we will slice a row corresponding to vertex v from this Matrix. This row (vector) of 0s and 1s will be of size n and the operation to find adjacent vertices will require us to iterate though it to find all entries with value 1. Thus the complexity of the operation to find adjacent vertices is $O(n)$\n",

The choice of data structure here is very important for storing the outgoing edges. If the set,  like a *Hash Set* is used, we can expect the *contains* operation for the vertex in each set to have a constant complexity ($O(1)$). Combining both, the iteration though all n - 1 vertices to search for the vertex in their outgoing edges and the constant time operation to check the existence of the vertex in each of the outgoing edges of a vertex, we can expect the overall operation to have a complexity $O(n)$\n",
